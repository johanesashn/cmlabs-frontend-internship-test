# Foodies : https://jofood.netlify.app/
This website is build by using ReactJs, Javascript, Es6, Ajax, jquery, HTML, and CSS
- You can see my ajax in src/components/Foods.jsx and src/components/Content.jsx
- You can see my jquery in src/components/Navbar.jsx
### Note: I don't use too many jquery syntax because in React there is better alternative for me
